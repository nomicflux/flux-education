## Design Philosophy
1) Complex ideas can always be broken down into simple notions. I shouldn't have a lesson that I can't explain in a simple sentence.
2) Math can always be visualized. There is no reason to have a lesson that doesn't also have a graphical & interactive component.
3) Math is more of an exploration than a set of equations to memorize. Lessons can branch off due to different questions, and a learner should be free to follow their questions instead of a single set path.

## Up Next
1) I'm working on abstract algebra first - that is, algebra as applied to patterns of all sorts and not just for numbers. From there, linear algebra seems to be a helpful tie-in (matrices and vectors - extremely useful in computer graphics, amongst other things).
2) Statistics! This seems to be a much-asked-for field, and I have some basic ideas already (for example, what is a bell curve, how do we get it, and why is that important?).
3) User accounts to track progress, once I have enough pages up for that to be worthwhile.
